nagios-plugins-lcgdm for Debian

This package is originally part of the LCGDM software and has never
been packaged for Debian. The common plug-ins however are generic
enough to be used outside of their original context.

None of the other plug-ins found in this source package are packaged
in a binary package, so this should not be considered as a straight
Debian port.
